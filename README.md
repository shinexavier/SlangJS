# SlangJS
A JavaScript Interpreter for SLANG

This project is a personal learning project in compiler construction. It is an attempt to port the interpreter (written in C#) that was created by my mentor and friend Praseed Pai K.T (a.k.a Pai) as part of his teaching endeavours. It has been a life changing experience and nothing describes the euphoria I get considering the fact I too have written an interpreter!

The code is wired based on the e-Book, written by the author himself, available in the Downloads section from http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/

The whole exercise is achieved in 6 Steps (Step 5 from the original 7 steps have been ignored thereby skipping compilation).
